# TORMATE is TOR's mate

Tor is a tool for annonymous communication over the internet.
However, there are a few websites that block traffic from the Tor network (or require solving a captcha, which cannot be done by your RSS reader etc..).
And that's why I implemented TORMATE.

## Motivation

As a Tor user you know that situation: a site is hosted on Cloudflare (or similar) and connections from Tor are blocked..
I just experiences it

with tormate you can fight against anti annonymity ;-)

## Setup

### Dockerised

## Licence
